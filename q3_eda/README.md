I selected this dataset as it allowed me to showcase some of my understanding of the techniques used in NLP focused EDA. 

While it is not exhaustive (I didn't perform any sentiment analysis, for instance, since the dataset came labelled) I think this collection of reviews allowed me to showcase what I would consider to be very important methods to understand your text data.

Thanks for taking a look,
Chris
