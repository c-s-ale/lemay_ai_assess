### Q1 Solution

This is my solution for the model deployment question of the Lemay AI assessment. 

In order to run the solution, please ensure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

You can run the container with the command `docker-compose up --build` from the directory `q1_solution` at which point you can send POST requests to '0.0.0.0:80/translate/en_to_fr/'.

Please include the json `{'text': YOUR_TEXT_HERE: str}` in your request in order to receive a translation back from the end-point!

After you successfully composed the container, feel free to head over to the folder `q1_test`, where you can run a test on this solution.

#### Reasoning

My reasoning for choosing this model is that it might provide value to a business, by way of translating english content to french content for increased reach in Canada. In addition, it is an effect that can be easily seen and understood - even by people without a technical background.

Thank you for your time,
Chris!
